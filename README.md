# reactorNuSpectrumGenerator
Allows user to specify different sources of reactor neutrino isotope fluxes calculations, weights, and energy range, and generates an output neutrino spectrum. Still a work in progress. Things to change are:
* Improve or give the user extrapolation options
* Include errors authors use in calculations. More difficult when data extracted from curves.
* Add power, core content data from real reactors

# Usage:
python reactorNuSpectrumGeneratory.py < config file >

# Explanation of config file
## spectrum_settings
* nbins: number of bins in output spectrum
* normalized: either "GW" for neutrinos/sec using supplied power, "pdf" for normalization to integral of 1, or anything else for neutrinos/fission
* emin: minimum energy of output spectrum
* emax: maximum energy of output spectrum

## data_sources
* For each isotope, filename to use from fluxData folder. Format of data is lines of "energy [in MeV], antineutrinos/fission". Comments start with a "#". If data does not cover requested (emin,emax) range, exponential extrapolation is done using five closest data points.
  
## reactor_data
* type: "manual" currently, plan to put in example reactor data later
* power: power in GW
* fraction_u235: fraction of u235 in core, does not have to be normalized
* fraction_u238: fraction of u238 in core, does not have to be normalized
* fraction_pu239: fraction of pu239 in core, does not have to be normalized
* fraction_pu241: fraction of pu241 in core, does not have to be normalized

## output_settings:
* format: either "text" or "root"
* output_name: name of the output file, with appropriate extension
